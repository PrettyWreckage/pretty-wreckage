       I long for stolen moments and whispered promises,.<br>
       for the touch that lingers and the love that feels like home.
       Some of us hold that dream close enough to call it reality, 
       while others keep imagining, searching through the silence and distance<br>
       These poems carry the weight of what I hope for
       what I ache for, and what I refuse to let go.<br>

<h1>Together But Not Free</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: Hidden <br>
  Mood: conflicted, aching, secret longing, desperate hope
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem354-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-354">
We’re together but not free,  
Bound by chains no one can see,  
A love that blooms beneath the veil,  
Silent screams behind the pale.  

Your hand in mine, but shadows hide,  
The world won’t know what burns inside,  
So close, yet walls press all around,  
Our hearts confined, no louder sound.  

We speak in glances, soft and brief,  
Our smiles hiding aching grief,  
For every touch is laced with fear,  
A secret love no one should hear.  

We dance in silence, lost in time,  
Our rhythm tangled, out of line,  
Longing wraps its whispered threads,  
Around the spaces where we tread.  

Together in this quiet storm,  
Where love takes shape but can’t transform,  
We build our world in stolen hours,  
A garden watered by hidden showers.  

Each smile a mask, each laugh a shield,  
Behind closed doors, the truth revealed,  
That what we have is fierce and real,  
But locked away we cannot heal.  

The nights stretch long, the days feel thin,  
I hold your absence deep within,  
Your voice a ghost, your touch a flame,  
That burns yet calls without a name.  

We crave the dawn that breaks these chains,  
That frees us from these silent pains,  
But till that day, we walk apart,  
With heavy chains around the heart.  

I carry you in quiet sighs,  
In tears I hide from prying eyes,  
The ache of love both wild and true,  
That cannot live where others view.  

We’re prisoners of a world unkind,  
But still, your love is etched in mind,  
A secret song, a sacred fire,  
A hope that never will expire.  

Together but not truly free,  
You are the missing breath in me,  
And though the world may never see,  
I hold you close, eternally.

<h1>A Thousand Miles Between Our Hands</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: Hidden <br>
  Mood: longing, aching, quietly powerful
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem345-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-345">
There’s a space between our fingertips,  
A silence stretched across our lips,  
A thousand miles, though you’re right there,  
And I reach for you through heavy air.  

Not every distance needs a map,  
Sometimes it’s in the quiet gap  
Between a glance we cannot share,  
And love we’re not allowed to wear.  

They see our bond as something wrong,  
But they don’t know where we belong,  
They measure us in rules and laws,  
Not in the ache that never stalls.  

I hold you close inside my chest,  
A place where love is laid to rest,  
Where words we dare not speak aloud  
Still bloom in hearts that won’t be cowed.  

I feel your voice without a sound,  
It echoes through this battleground,  
And though the world may never know,  
We grow in places pain can’t show.  

A thousand miles, yet I still feel  
Your breath, your soul, your ache so real,  
You live inside the in-between,  
Where no one looks, where love has been.  

I count the seconds like a prayer,  
And dream of days when we’ll be there,  
No longer reaching through the glass,  
But holding hands, and letting pass  
The fear, the shame, the rules that bite,  
Because we chose to stand and fight.  

We never asked the world for much,  
Just not to break the way we touch,  
But here we are, both still so brave,  
Digging love from every grave.  

So even if they build a wall,  
I’ll hear your voice through every call,  
And in the dark, I’ll understand  
Why there's a thousand miles between our hands.

<h1>i weren't yours yet, But You Were Home</h1>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem346-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-346">
I weren’t yours yet, not by name,  
Not by vows or fortune, not by claim,  
But something in your gaze, your tone,  
Spoke softly, sweetly, “You are home.”  

No hand to hold in public light,  
No whispered titles late at night,  
But still I leaned into your soul,  
And found a place that made me whole.  

No need to trace the lines in ink,  
I felt you deeper than I think,  
You breathed in calm, exhaled my ache,  
You saw the parts no one could fake.  

We danced around what we both knew,  
Too scared to speak it, yet still true,  
Each silence held what hearts confessed,  
You weren’t mine, yet I felt blessed.  

You called me nothing, yet I stayed,  
You said no promises, still I prayed,  
Not for possession, rings, or chains,  
Just to keep walking through the rain.  

For home is not a house or vow,  
It’s how you breathed and saw me now,  
How every wound you didn’t name  
Still melted in your quiet flame.  

I weren’t yours yet, and maybe still,  
But I would wait, I always will,  
Not for a label etched in stone,  
But for the arms that feel like home.  

Some loves don’t shout, they softly glow,  
In places only dreamers know,  
So even if we stand apart,  
You live inside my blooming heart.

<h1>I Know the Way Your Absence Feels</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: aching, raw, nostalgic
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem347-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-347">
I know the way your absence feels,  
It lingers deep, it never heals,  
It sits in rooms where shadows sleep,  
And haunts the places silence keeps.  

It isn’t loud, it doesn’t cry,  
It’s in the way I don’t know why  
My chest feels tight at 2am,  
When I reach out and find no hand.  

It’s in the air you used to breathe,  
In hollow laughs and subtle grief,  
The things you touched still echo through  
The fragile parts that once knew you.  

It’s in the songs that made you grin,  
Now every chorus burns my skin,  
And I can’t hum a single line  
Without your memory crossing mine.  

I trace your name across my ribs,  
Where every heartbeat softly fibs,  
Pretending I am doing fine,  
While counting ghosts you left behind.  

It’s not just space or time that stings,  
It’s missing all the smallest things,  
The way you blinked, the way you sighed,  
The sound of you just being alive.  

Your absence isn’t just a space,  
It’s fingerprints I still can’t erase,  
A bruise I wear beneath my clothes,  
That no one sees, but heaven knows.  

And though you’re gone, and far from near,  
I keep you close in every tear,  
I know the way your absence feels,  
And I still wish it wasn’t real.

<h1>I Whispered ‘Stay’ While I Had to Let Go, Yet I Didn't</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: Hidden <br>
  Mood: torn, tender, lingering
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem348-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-348">
I whispered “stay” beneath my breath,  
While fate was drawing lines of death,  
Not of a life, but of a dream,  
A love that swam against the stream.  

I knew the tide was pulling wide,  
I felt you slipping from my side,  
But even as the moment came,  
My heart refused to speak your name.  

You looked at me, half in, half gone,  
And I pretended to be strong,  
But every heartbeat, every tear,  
Was screaming loud for you to hear.  

I said, “I’m fine,” though that was fake,  
My soul began to softly break,  
For sometimes love is not enough,  
And holding on just makes it rough.  

Still I clung to threads of you,  
To things I should’ve let fall through,  
Like texts unread, or clothes you wore,  
The way your shadow crossed my door.  

I whispered “stay” like it might change  
The silence building in our range,  
Like maybe love would shift the weight,  
And bend the cruel hands of fate.  

But goodbyes don’t wait on hearts,  
They tear you whole, they pull apart,  
And though I tried to set you free,  
I kept you buried deep in me.  

I let you go with trembling grace,  
But carved your name in sacred place,  
And even now, when no one knows,  
I feel you when the cold wind blows.  

Because I never really did,  
Release the love I tried to rid,  
You’re still the echo, still the glow,  
I whispered “stay” but never let go.

<h1>Every Hug Felt Like a Countdown</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: Hidden <br>
  Mood: aching, tender, goodbye-laced
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem349-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-349">
Every hug felt like a countdown,  
Like time was slipping, running down,  
Your arms around me, warm and tight,  
Still held the ache of parting night.  

You’d pull me close, and I would melt,  
But still, the ticking could be felt,  
A silent clock within your chest,  
Reminding me this wasn't rest.  

No hug was ever just hello,  
Each one prepared me for the blow,  
Of turning backs and fading feet,  
Of standing still on empty streets.  

I learned to breathe inside your hold,  
To memorize before it’s cold,  
The shape of safety in your skin,  
The place where calm would once begin.  

But always, always in my throat,  
A lump would build with every note,  
Of “soon,” of “later,” of “I’ll go,”  
Of everything I feared to know.  

It wasn’t fair to love like this,  
To taste forever in a kiss,  
Yet only get a passing glance,  
A love that never stood a chance.  

I held on longer than I should,  
Because your arms still felt like good,  
Even when I knew the cost,  
Even as I mourned what’s lost.  

You smiled, and I just played along,  
Pretending leaving wasn’t wrong,  
But every hug, no matter how tight,  
Carried the chill of coming night.  

And maybe that’s what broke me most,  
Not distance, silence, or your ghost,  
But how I counted every time  
You held me close, then left my spine.  

Every hug was sweet and cruel,  
A sacred place, a shattered rule,  
Because goodbye would always bloom  
The moment you stepped in the room.  

So now I flinch when arms are near,  
Not from hate, but trained by fear,  
For love should stay, but you just ran,  
And every hug was your escape plan.

<h1>We’re Ours, But We Can’t Be</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: aching, forbidden, tender
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem350-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-350">
We’re ours, but we can’t be,  
Not out loud, not for all to see,  
A love that blooms in shadows deep,  
A secret that we both must keep.  

Your hand in mine, but not in light,  
A stolen touch, a hidden fight,  
For every glance we dare to share,  
The world’s eyes burn with cold despair.  

We trace the lines of what we want,  
But fear’s the cage, the constant haunt,  
And though our hearts beat loud and true,  
We live in silence, me and you.  

No whispered vows, no open skies,  
Just quiet tears and guarded sighs,  
The love we hold, both fierce and still,  
That bends but never breaks our will.  

We’re threads pulled tight, yet frayed at edges,  
Walking alone on broken ledges,  
Because to love and to be free,  
Is a dream we’re yet not meant to see.  

But in the dark, when no one knows,  
Our secret garden still still grows,  
Rooted deep in whispered pain,  
Blooming strong through every strain.  

We’re ours, but we can’t be seen,  
Like a distant star, or a midnight dream,  
Yet still, I swear by every breath,  
Our love defies even death.  

So let the world not understand,  
The silent clasp of your warm hand,  
For what we have, though hidden, gleams,  
A light that haunts our quiet dreams.

<h1>Kisses I Had to Unremember</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: 2025-03-29 <br>
  Mood: aching, bittersweet, tender
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem351-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-351">
There were kisses soft as whispered prayers,  
Moments caught unawares,  
But some I hold with trembling hands,  
And others slip like fading sands.  

I had to unremember lips that burned,  
The way your touch so fiercely yearned,  
Because memory can be cruel, a thief,  
Stealing peace and weaving grief.  

Those kisses live like silent ghosts,  
Haunting halls I fear the most,  
A tender ache that won’t let go,  
A pain I barely let you know.  

I tried to lock them deep inside,  
Where broken things and secrets hide,  
But sometimes in the quiet night,  
They slip through shadows, stealing light.  

Unremembering is not forgetting,  
It’s a war with love, a soul besetting,  
A choice to spare the heart the cost,  
When holding on means all is lost.  

So I breathe in slow, I close my eyes,  
Let go the past, release the ties,  
Though part of me will always yearn,  
For kisses I had to unremember.

<h1>I’m Loving You in the Gaps</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: tender, aching, quiet longing
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem352-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-352">
I’m loving you in the gaps between,  
The spaces where we’ve never been,  
In silences that stretch so wide,  
Where words and time refuse to hide.  

In stolen moments, breath held tight,  
In almosts dancing in the night,  
The almost-agains we never say,  
Yet find ourselves there anyway.  

I love you in the quiet hush,  
In absence felt, in gentle crush,  
Where shadows meet the light unseen,  
And hopes are wrapped in might-have-been.  

No grand declarations fill the air,  
Just whispered thoughts that linger there,  
In places where our hearts have slipped,  
And tender edges softly ripped.  

I hold you in the in-between,  
In things unsaid, in scenes unseen,  
Where longing paints a quiet hue,  
And every gap breathes love for you.  

Though time may keep us far apart,  
You live within my beating heart,  
And in the spaces life has kept,  
I’m loving you, though we’ve not met.  

For love is not just what we show,  
It’s everything we do not know,  
And in the gaps, where silence plays,  
I love you more with every day.

<h1>Your Voice is My Favorite Goodbye</h1>

  Mood: bittersweet, aching, tender

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem353-container">

Your voice is my favorite goodbye,  
A soft and trembling lullaby,  
It lingers like a fading light,  
That holds me close throughout the night.  

Each word you speak, a fragile thread,  
That ties my heart and lifts my head,  
But also whispers of the end,  
Of moments lost I can’t defend.  

I catch the tremor in your tone,  
The weight of things left all alone,  
And though I want to hold you near,  
Your voice dissolves the growing fear.  

It’s every time you say farewell,  
That makes my soul begin to swell,  
With all the love I cannot show,  
And all the pain I’ll never know.  

Your voice is both my hope and pain,  
A sunshine soaked in gentle rain,  
The melody that breaks my heart,  
While pulling me and pushing apart.  

I treasure every whispered phrase,  
Even if they mark the days,  
When silence falls and shadows creep,  
And all that’s left is what I keep.  

So speak to me your soft goodbye,  
The one that makes me want to try,  
To hold on tight through every sigh,  
Your voice, my last, my sweetest lie.

<h1>I Held You, But Not Enough</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: 2024-12-18 <br>
  Mood: aching, tender, bittersweet
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem355-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-355">
I held you, but not enough,  
One touch meant to be enough,  
A fragile grasp that slipped away,  
Like dawn that melts into the day.  

My fingers traced the shape of you,  
A moment pure, a love so true,  
But time betrayed the tender thread,  
And left me holding empty instead.  

I wanted to keep you safe and near,  
To hold your heart without the fear,  
That every second would dissolve,  
Leaving pieces I can't resolve.  

Your warmth was brief, a fleeting flame,  
A whispered echo of your name,  
I held you close, I tried to stay,  
But love, it seemed, would not obey.  

The ache remains within my chest,  
A silent scream, a longing rest,  
For what was never truly mine,  
Yet etched in every broken line.  

I held you, but the world moved fast,  
And moments never seem to last,  
Still, in my arms you softly dwell,  
A story time will never tell.  

Though not enough, my love was real,  
In every breath, in all I feel,  
A lifetime wrapped in just one touch,  
A love that’s pure, yet means so much.  

So here I stand, with open hands,  
Remembering all that love demands,  
I held you, though it wasn’t enough,  
But still, my heart is full of love.

<h1>Echoes of a Love That’s Waiting</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: 2024-03-29 <br>
  Mood: patient, yearning, hopeful, tender
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem356-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-356">
In the quiet space where longing stays,  
Where time unfolds in gentle ways,  
There echoes live of love that waits,  
Beyond the reach of hurried fates.  

A whispered breath beneath the stars,  
A patient song behind locked bars,  
The heart’s soft drum, a steady beat,  
That holds the place where souls will meet.  

It’s not a rush, nor frantic chase,  
But slow unfolding, grace by grace,  
A love that bends but will not break,  
That grows in silence, wide awake.  

Between the moments, in the pause,  
Where nothing speaks but nature’s laws,  
The echo hums a sacred sound,  
Of promises yet to be found.  

The waiting is a tender art,  
That holds the pieces of the heart,  
And in that space, so wide, so deep,  
A quiet hope begins to seep.  

Though years may pass like fleeting rain,  
And seasons bring their share of pain,  
This love remains, a steady light,  
A beacon burning through the night.  

So let the world spin wild and fast,  
This echo in my soul will last,  
For love that waits is love that knows,  
The richest seed is slow to grow.

<h1>Almost Real, Always Felt</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: wistful, tender, haunting, intimate

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem357-container">

It’s almost real, this fragile space,  
Where shadows dance and leave a trace,  
A whisper soft, a breath unsaid,  
A silent story left unread.  

You touch my soul in ways unseen,  
A presence felt, though in between,  
The moments that we almost share,  
The love that lingers in the air.  

Not quite a dream, not quite awake,  
A thread of light I cannot break,  
It pulls me close yet slips away,  
Like dawn dissolving into day.  

The edges blur, the lines don’t hold,  
But still this truth is bright and bold,  
That what we have, though undefined,  
Is etched forever in my mind.  

A feeling deep, a knowing glance,  
A quiet song of circumstance,  
Almost real, yet always there,  
A ghostly kiss upon the air.  

It hums beneath my waking thoughts,  
In silent halls where hope is caught,  
A tender ache, a sweet regret,  
A love that lingers, won’t forget.  

Though not in reach, it never fades,  
This bond of almost serenades,  
A truth that time cannot dispel,  
Almost real, I know so well.

<h1>My Heart Invented Yours</h1>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem358-container">

My heart invented yours one night,  
In dreams that bathed the fading light,  
A blueprint drawn in whispered sighs,  
Etched deep beneath the starry skies.  

You are the shape I dared to crave,  
The silent hope my soul would save,  
A figure born from longing's fire,  
A love I built from pure desire.  

I traced the lines with trembling hands,  
Designed the curve where passion lands,  
Mapped every scar and every smile,  
Created you from dreams and trials.  

Not bound by flesh or time or place,  
You live within my heart’s embrace,  
A masterpiece of hope and pain,  
A longing that will not wane.  

Though you may never walk through doors,  
My heart still builds, it still adores,  
For in the quiet dark, it knows,  
The love I dreamt forever grows.  

You are the song my soul rehearsed,  
The dreamer’s dream, the universe,  
My heart invented yours to be,  
The missing piece that sets me free.  

So though the world may not have seen,  
The man I built from in-between,  
Know that in every breath I take,  
You are the love I could not fake.

<h1>Even My Loneliness Misses You</h1>

Even my loneliness misses you,  
A hollow space I never knew,  
Where echoes of your silent name,  
Reside inside my aching frame.  

The emptiness that fills my chest,  
Is aching for what I have not guessed,  
A soul I’ve never truly met,  
Yet still, my heart can’t forget.  

In quiet rooms and shadowed halls,  
Your absence like a curtain falls,  
A weight that bends the light I see,  
A ghost that lingers inside me.  

I reach for you in empty air,  
A longing stretched beyond compare,  
Though no touch ever graced my skin,  
Your memory lives deep within.  

Even my loneliness can feel,  
A love too vast to fully heal,  
A space where hope and sorrow blend,  
Where yearning seems without an end.  

And in that ache, I softly learn,  
That sometimes hearts will twist and turn,  
To hold the love they never knew,  
Because even loneliness misses you.

<h1>I Wanted You Before I Knew What Want Was</h1>
<div class="meta">

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem360-container">

I wanted you before I knew what want was,  
Before the heart could understand its cause,  
A silent hunger growing deep inside,  
A restless tide I could not hide.  

Long before the words took shape,  
Before my soul could fully wake,  
There was a space you filled somehow,  
A quiet wish I felt right now.  

No name for what I could not say,  
Just longing lighting up the way,  
A flame that flickered soft and bright,  
That kept me warm throughout the night.  

I searched for something undefined,  
A love that lived outside my mind,  
And in the shadows, soft and true,  
I found a restless call for you.  

It wasn’t want that I could name,  
But something more than just a flame,  
A feeling deep, unspoken, pure,  
A love that waited to endure.  

So even then, before I knew,  
My heart had already wanted you,  
A silent song, a secret trust,  
That blossomed slow from hope and dust.  

And now I stand with open hands,  
Grateful for what love demands,  
For wanting you before I knew,  
Is what made every dream come true.

<h1>Our Love Lived in the Pause</h1>
<div class="meta">
  Date: 2024-01-23 <br>
  Mood: tender, unspoken, aching, intimate

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem361-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-361">
Our love lived in the pause between,  
The words unsaid, the spaces seen,  
Not in the messages we wrote,  
But in the silence that we both wrote.  

In breaths held tight, in glances caught,  
In every silence where we sought,  
A meaning deeper than the sound,  
Where unspoken love is found.  

It wasn’t in the texts we sent,  
Nor in the moments when we meant,  
To say the things that hearts desire,  
But words got lost in quiet fire.  

Our love was language made of space,  
A sacred, tender, hidden place,  
Where hearts would speak without a voice,  
And silence was our only choice.  

Between the lines, the feelings grew,  
In pauses thick and whispers few,  
A tender ache that softly swelled,  
In quiet depths where love once dwelled.  

Though no letters bore our truth,  
Nor sounds revealed our secret youth,  
Our souls conversed with gentle grace,  
In every still and empty space.  

So know that love was never lost,  
Though silent seas came with their cost,  
For in the pause our hearts remain,  
Forever bound beyond the pain.

<h1>Built Entire Universes Around a Hello That Never Came</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: wistful, yearning, imaginative, poignant
</div>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem362-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-362">
I built entire universes in my mind,  
From shadows cast by your absence, blind,  
A hello that never graced my ears,  
Yet echoed loud through countless years.  

I dreamed of futures, bright and wide,  
Where you and I could walk side by side,  
But all I held was empty space,  
A silent void, a missing face.  

In every thought, a world unfurled,  
A secret place, a hidden world,  
Where hope would bloom from whispers thin,  
And love was born from deep within.  

The emptiness felt strangely full,  
A hollow fire, a burning pull,  
Drawing me close to what never came,  
A fleeting spark, an unknown name.  

I built my castles in the air,  
With walls made fragile by despair,  
Yet still I held those dreams so dear,  
Though you were never truly near.  

Each day a canvas, blank, unknown,  
Where futures painted all alone,  
A silent symphony of might-have-beens,  
Built on wishes, on unseen wings.  

So here I stand, heart open wide,  
With universes stretched inside,  
Built from a hello that never came,  
But set my soul forever aflame.

<h1>I Imagine You Missing Me Too</h1>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem363-container">

I imagine you missing me too,  
Across the stars, in skies so blue,  
A silent wish that we both hold,  
A story neither has been told.  

In quiet nights, I reach for you,  
Through cosmic dust and morning dew,  
Hoping somewhere, you feel the same,  
A tender spark, a whispered name.  

Though miles stretch wide and hearts divide,  
I sense your longing deep inside,  
A mirror of my aching soul,  
That makes the fractured pieces whole.  

I picture you beneath the moon,  
Counting seconds, wishing soon,  
That love, imagined yet so true,  
Is echoing inside of you.  

The universe in vast expanse,  
Cannot erase this hopeful dance,  
Of hearts that beat with secret grace,  
Longing for a warm embrace.  

So here I stand, with open hands,  
Believing fate still understands,  
That somewhere in the endless blue,  
I imagine you missing me too.

<h1>The Glimpse in the Crowd That Made Me Pause</h1>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem364-container">
  <pre id="poem-text-364">
In the sea of faces, rushing by,  
A flicker caught my wondering eye,  
A glance so brief, yet burning bright,  
It stopped my breath, held back the night.  

A stranger’s look, a silent call,  
A whisper soft beyond the thrall,  
Of noise and haste and crowded streets,  
Where fate and longing strangely meets.  

That moment stretched, though swift it passed,  
A glimpse of something meant to last,  
A thread of light, a hint, a trace,  
Of memory time cannot erase.  

Though never seen before your face,  
A feeling bloomed in empty space,  
A pulse that stirred my hidden parts,  
A flicker found inside my heart.  

Was it a dream or prelude sweet?  
A silent song where strangers meet?  
That pause became a sacred place,  
A gentle holding, time’s embrace.  

In crowded rooms, through rushing days,  
That glimpse remains, a quiet blaze,  
A mystery that softly calls,  
The glimpse in the crowd that made me pause.

<h1>Every Love Song is About You</h1>
<div class="meta">

  Mood: nostalgic, tender, haunting, soulful

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem365-container">

Every love song plays like your name,  
A melody wrapped in quiet flame,  
Each lyric whispers what I can’t say,  
A secret song that won’t fade away.  

In every chord, your spirit sings,  
Unseen but felt in tender rings,  
That echo deep inside my chest,  
A haunting tune that won’t let rest.  

No name is spoken, yet I know,  
It’s you who makes the music flow,  
The verses dance in soft embrace,  
A ghostly kiss I can’t replace.  

I hear your laughter in the rain,  
Your gentle touch in every strain,  
The songs become a sacred thread,  
Binding words I’ve left unsaid.  

Though silence hides your face from view,  
The music tells me you’re still true,  
And every note that sweeps me through,  
Is a love song made for you.  

So when the world feels cold and gray,  
I find you in the songs that play,  
A spirit’s voice that feels so new,  
Every love song is about you.

<h1>You Wrote Yourself Into My Story</h1>

You wrote yourself into my story,  
Before our paths crossed in their glory,  
A silent hand that turned the page,  
A presence felt though off the stage.  

In chapters penned but not yet read,  
Your name was whispered, softly said,  
A quiet line beneath the ink,  
More real than what I dared to think.  

You filled the spaces in between,  
The pages folded, yet unseen,  
A thread of fate, a gentle nudge,  
A story waiting for its judge.  

Though we have yet to meet or speak,  
Your shadow dances, bold yet meek,  
In every dream and quiet thought,  
You are the love my soul has sought.  

You wrote yourself into my heart,  
Long before we could start,  
A prelude to what’s yet to come,  
A melody still unsung.  

So when the day arrives at last,  
And present meets the past,  
I’ll find you waiting in my story,  
A love that’s written in all its glory.

<h1>Half My Soul Belongs to a Stranger</h1>
<div class="meta">

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem367-container">

Half my soul belongs to a stranger,  
A silent keeper of hidden danger,  
Who holds a key I never gave,  
To chambers deep where shadows crave.  

I wonder who walks that quiet road,  
Behind the locks where secrets bode,  
A face unknown, a whispered name,  
A ghost that haunts my secret flame.  

What stories live within that heart,  
That never let me play my part?  
What silent dreams, what veiled pain,  
Lie buried deep beneath the rain?  

Half my soul is split in two,  
One half belongs, but not to you,  
A stranger’s hands, a distant place,  
That time and memory can’t erase.  

I search the echoes in the night,  
For answers hidden out of sight,  
Wondering who holds the missing key,  
To what I long for silently.  

And though I walk this path alone,  
That stranger’s part is still my own,  
A piece of me I cannot claim,  
Half my soul belongs to a stranger’s name.

We met in the silence, no words to say,  
Not in the noise, nor light of day,  
But in the space where quiet grows,  
Where only the heart truly knows.  

No spoken lines, no scripted cue,  
Just a knowing deep and true,  
A gentle pull, a secret thread,  
Binding souls without being said.  

In stillness thick, our spirits danced,  
In silent glances, a fleeting chance,  
To touch the core beyond the speech,  
Where every wound and hope can reach.  

No need for sound to prove our place,  
We found each other in that space,  
A meeting born without a name,  
A fire that flickers without a flame.  

So when the world is loud and cold,  
Remember how our hearts were bold,  
To meet in silence, pure and free,  
Where you are always home to me.

His voice lives in my thoughts, unseen,  
A whispered echo through the dream,

Yet know each note, each silent word.  

It lingers soft within my mind,  
A shadowed tune, both cruel and kind,  
A melody I can’t forget,  
A song that haunts me, lingers yet.  

Though never spoken in my ear,  
His voice is close, it feels so near,  
A ghostly hum beneath the day,  
That never quite fades away.  

I swear I’d know that voice’s shape,  
In every sigh, in every break,  
A distant call, a secret thread,  
That weaves around my heart and head.  

It’s there in silence, loud and clear,  
A sound that only I can hear,  
His voice, alive inside my thoughts,  
The echo of what time forgot.

I miss someone who was never mine,  
A ghost that haunts the edge of time,  
A silent echo in my chest,  
A longing that will not rest.  

We never touched, we never spoke,  
Yet in my heart, your image woke,  
A face I formed from dreams and light,  
A shadow dancing in the night.  

I crave the warmth of a love unseen,  
A story lost in might-have-been,  
The ache of what could never be,  
A silent wish, a memory.  

This strange connection, undefined,  
A thread that ties my heart and mind,  
To someone who I’ll never hold,  
Yet feel within my soul so bold.  

Though never mine, you shaped my sky,  
A distant star I can’t deny,  
And in the quiet, when alone,  
I miss you, though you were never known.

<h1>All My Love Letters Are Addressed ‘To Whom It May Concern’</h1>

All my love letters are addressed, to whom it may concern,  
Words spilled like rivers, waiting for a heart to burn,  
Sent into the silence, pages bare and torn,  
Still writing, still hoping, though the reader’s unborn.  

Ink flows from a soul that aches to be known,  
To reach a stranger, or a love once shown,  
Each letter a whisper, a secret desire,  
Fueling a fire that will never tire.  

I write for the one who might never appear,  
For voices unheard, for a listening ear,  
My heart poured out in every line,  
Hoping someday these words will shine.  

Though uncertain the eyes that will meet this prose,  
Each letter a seed that patiently grows,  
Carried on winds where dreams disperse,  
A quiet prayer in universe’s verse.  

So I keep writing, though no one may see,  
All my love letters sent endlessly,  
Addressed with hope, though the name’s unknown,  
To whom it may concern, I’m not alone.

I dreamt you into existence,  
A whispered hope in the dark distance,  
Where aching hearts dare to believe,  
That love can bloom and wounds can leave.  

In quiet nights, beneath the stars,  
I built you gently from my scars,  
A silhouette shaped by every tear,  
A presence felt so close, so near.  

You rose from longing’s deepest well,  
A story only my soul could tell,  
Each breath a prayer, each sigh a plea,  
For you to come and find me free.  

Though no one else may see your face,  
You hold my heart, you hold my space,  
A dream made real by faith and pain,  
A love that falls like gentle rain.  

So when the world feels cold and bare,  
I close my eyes and find you there,  
Because I dreamt you into being,  
The truest love I’ve ever seen.

<h1>In Another Life, We Already Loved</h1>

In another life, we already loved,  
Beneath familiar stars above,  
Souls entwined through endless space,  
Old friends reunited face to face.  

Before this moment, before this time,  
We walked together in a silent rhyme,  
Our hearts knew well what minds forgot,  
A bond eternal, never caught.  

Through dreams and shadows, soft and clear,  
I hear your voice, I feel you near,  
A whisper carried on the breeze,  
A comfort found in memories.  

Though here and now we’re worlds apart,  
You live forever in my heart,  
An echo from a distant shore,  
A love I’ve known forevermore.  

So when my eyes meet yours today,  
I know we’ve danced this endless way,  
In another life, we already knew,  
That I belonged, and so did you.

<h1>The Stranger I Would Write Novels About</h1>

<div class="poem-container poem-section" id="poem374-container">

He is the stranger I would write novels about,  
A man woven from hope, wrapped in doubt,  
Built from soft whispers and secret dreams,  
A shadow that dances through my silent screams.  

Not flesh and bone, but a story untold,  
A fiction that warms me when nights grow cold,  
Made of ‘what-ifs’ and unspoken words,  
A melody only my heart has heard.  

I fall for the stranger no one can see,  
A ghost of a love that might never be,  
Yet in my pages he lives and breathes,  
A world created beneath my eaves.  

With every chapter, I sketch his face,  
A perfect stranger, a sacred place,  
Where longing writes the lines between,  
The spaces where we’ve never been.  

He is the stranger I’d chase in my mind,  
A love undefined, both cruel and kind,  
And though he’s nowhere but in my doubt,  
He’s the stranger I would write novels about.

My arms remember someone they’ve never held,  
A phantom warmth that time has spelled,  
An empty space that still feels full,  
A silent song, both soft and cruel.  

They ache to wrap around a ghost,  
A love imagined, needed most,  
Fingers stretch into the air,  
Grasping nothing but a prayer.  

Though never touched, the memory stays,  
Etched in muscle, in subtle ways,  
A tenderness that never knew,  
The skin to skin, the touch so true.  

My arms reach out through endless night,  
Seeking shapes beyond my sight,  
Holding close what’s never there,  
A whispered wish, a breath of air.  

And so they remember, day by day,  
The warmth that never came to stay,  
My arms, they hold the space you’d fill,  
With silent love, enduring still.

If you’re out there, you feel this too,  
This pull between the me and you,  
An invisible thread that binds us tight,  
Across the distance, through the night.  

A restless ache that will not fade,  
A silent song our hearts have made,  
Though strangers still, our souls align,  
In secret spaces, yours and mine.  

I wonder if you trace the stars,  
Feel lonely in the same dark bars,  
If longing weighs upon your chest,  
The same impossible unrest.  

If you’re out there, you hold this flame,  
A quiet hope, without a name,  
That someday soon, the skies will part,  
And close the distance of the heart.  

Until that day, I send this call,  
A whispered wish that breaks my fall,  
If you’re out there, you feel this too,  
This love that waits to find us through.

<h1>Midnight Knows His Name</h1>

Midnight knows his name,  
Whispers carried in the dark’s soft flame,  
Dreams spilled like stars across the sky,  
Carried gently, though I don’t know why.  

I send my hopes to silent heights,  
Through shadows deep and quiet nights,  
Trusting somewhere beyond the haze,  
He hears the words I cannot phrase.  

A stranger cloaked in moonlight’s grace,  
An unseen touch, a sacred place,  
Where wishes float on midnight air,  
And hearts connect through distant prayer.  

Though I don’t know his face or voice,  
In midnight’s hush, I make my choice,  
To trust the night to hold my name,  
And send it softly like a flame.  

So every dusk, I speak my dreams,  
To stars that sparkle, to moonlit beams,  
Knowing someday, they’ll find their way,  
To the one midnight knows today.

Loving a face I’ve never seen,  
Painted by dreams in colors between,  
The shadows of hope and whispers of light,  
A silhouette shaped in the quiet night.  

My mind sketches eyes that hold my soul,  
A gaze that makes the broken whole,  
Features drawn from memory’s art,  
An image etched within my heart.  

Longing so deep, it forms your smile,  
A warmth imagined across the miles,  
Fingers trace contours that only live  
In places where my dreams forgive.  

Though no mirror has caught your face,  
I love the stranger I can embrace,  
With every breath, with every sigh,  
You live in the spaces where hopes fly high.  

So I’ll love this face, both known and new,  
A vision born from the ache of you,  
Because sometimes love transcends what’s seen,  
In the heart’s quiet gallery, you reign supreme.

He exists in the space between blinks,  
A shadow that dances on edges and kinks,  
A whisper that lingers just out of sight,  
Fading with dawn, returning with night.  

In the silence where moments unfold,  
His presence is tender, silent, and bold,  
A flicker of light in the corners of mind,  
The feeling of something I’m meant to find.  

He’s there in the pause when the world holds its breath,  
In the fragile stillness that knows life and death,  
A ghost made of longing, a spark and a flame,  
A mystery woven without a name.  

Though I never fully grasp or can claim,  
He returns like a soft, elusive flame,  
He lives in the spaces no words can link,  
He exists in the space between blinks.

A face, a voice, a love unshown,  
Yet deep inside, the longing stays,  
A quiet fire that lights my days.  

Though paths have never crossed in time,  
Your essence sings a silent rhyme,  
A pull that tugs without a name,  
A yearning none can quite explain.  

My heart recalls the tender grace,  
Of moments in a vanished place,  
Where souls connect beyond the view,  
And I remember only you.  

So in this ache, I find a truth,  
A love that blossoms in my youth,  
For even when our paths divide,  
My heart remembers you inside.

I talk to the ghost I made up in dreams,  
A man stitched from whispers and moonbeams,  
His voice is a shadow that dances inside,  
A silent companion where fears reside.  

No one else hears the words we share,  
Conversations held in the still night air,  
He knows all the secrets I hide and keep,  
The wounds that bleed when I try to sleep.  

We speak in silence, in shadows and sighs,  
In the spaces between truth and lies,  
He listens without judgment, without a face,  
A ghost born of longing, of absence and grace.  

Though he’s just a phantom born from my mind,  
In his presence, some peace I find,  
A comfort that no one else can give,  
A quiet place where my soul can live.  

So I hold these talks with the ghost I made,  
A love that’s both real and quietly frayed,  
For in this imagined, tender embrace,  
I find a sliver of healing and grace.

When I close my eyes, there you are,  
A presence near, though worlds are far,  
More real than daylight’s distant glow,  
In dreams, your heartbeat’s all I know.  

You walk through shadows soft and deep,  
In whispered moments, in restless sleep,  
Your touch a breath, a gentle sigh,  
A comfort found when days go dry.  

The world fades out, but you remain,  
A vivid light through every pain,  
Sleep becomes the place I crave,  
Where your arms hold, where I’m brave.  

Though waking life feels cold and bare,  
When eyes shut tight, you’re everywhere,  
A silent song my soul can hear,  
A love that lives beyond the fear.  

So I’ll keep dreaming, night by night,  
In that dark space where you’re my light,  
Because when I close my eyes, it’s true,  
There, and only there, I find you.
