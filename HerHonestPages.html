        text: `It’s the middle of the night, and my mind feels like a storm that won’t let up. Everything inside me is screaming, screaming to be let out, but I can’t make a sound. Not out loud. Not in this house. So instead, I’m writing it here. My quiet scream.

A few months ago, something happened, something I never imagined would become part of my story. One of his closest friends, who had also become mine, someone I trusted, someone I laughed with, someone I considered family... he raped me. He assaulted me. And what tears me apart is how familiar the aftermath felt, how easily my body slid into numbness like it had done so many times before. I’m so used to being mistreated, so used to pain being folded into the background of my life, that I almost accepted it like muscle memory.

But please don’t think I didn’t fight. I fought with everything I had. But I guess I wasn’t strong enough, not physically. That part of me always feels too small, too powerless.

Emotionally though… I’ve become a master at survival. At burying the unspoken. At locking it away so deep that even I can pretend it never happened. I have to. Because telling the truth would mean losing one of the only people I have left.

His wife… she’s my best friend. My only friend. The first real connection I’ve had since Kayla died in 2015. After her, everything went silent. I stopped letting people in. I became too quiet, too shy, too emotional, or maybe just too… me. And yet, somehow, she saw past all that and chose me anyway. I can't risk losing her. I won’t.

But it’s hard. So fucking hard.

We all live under the same roof. Every day I see his face. Every day he walks around like nothing ever happened. He laughs. He jokes. He eats dinner at the same table. And I have to pretend, pretend I’m okay, pretend I’m not shaking inside, pretend that my skin doesn’t crawl every time he gets too close.

I don’t know how to act around him. Do I keep pretending, keep smiling like I don’t remember? Or do I shut him out, avoid him completely, and risk people asking questions? My husband would notice in a second. He knows the dynamics of this house, he knows how we all interact. If I change, he’ll see it. And then… I’ll have to tell him.

But what would I even say? "He raped me."

Will he believe me?

Doubt seeps in like poison because I have no proof. No bruises that still show. No photos. No witnesses. Just my word against his.

And hasn’t my word always fallen short?

That’s what eats at me most, not just what happened, but how alone I feel in holding it. I can’t write this on paper; he might find it. I can’t type it in my phone; my husband checks it sometimes. But here… here feels safe. This digital corner of the universe where no one knows my name, where I can scream without sound, cry without consequence.

Maybe one day, my future self will stumble across this entry and remember not the pain, but the power it took to live through it. To keep breathing. To carry this weight in silence, but still stand. Still fight. Still love.

I am struggling. God, I am struggling.

But I’m still here. I’m still surviving. And right now… that’s enough.

If by any chance someone out there reads this, and you're holding a secret that’s killing you from the inside out, know that I see you. I get it. If you need someone to listen without judgment, without a name, without fear… I’m here. Just a human heart on the other side of the screen. Open. Honest. And aching just like you.`

No warning, no reason. Just a moment of silence between us and then his rage exploded into my skin. My cheek still stings. I pressed ice against it for a while, but what’s the point? It’s not the swelling that hurts the most, it’s the silence that follows. The way he turns his back like I deserved it. I sit here now in the dark, wondering when I stopped being human to him. I flinch when he breathes too loud. That’s not love. That’s fear in a wedding ring.`

Not to die.
Just to feel something that made sense. Something that bleeds, because my heart’s been bleeding in silence for so long that I needed to match it on the outside. 
My wrist is a canvas of pain no one ever asks about. Each wound a sentence I never got to say out loud. I’ll cover them. I always do. But God, I wish someone would notice.`

She didn’t ask. She didn’t judge. She just looked up and said, “Mommy, your skin is sad.”
I couldn’t breathe for a moment.
She’s only five. How does she know how to see through me when the adults in my life can’t even hear me scream? I locked myself in the bathroom and cried until my face burned. I have to get better. For her. For all of them. Even if I don’t want to live for *me*, I have to live for them.
But God, it's so fucking hard.`

That same smug face, like nothing ever happened. I avoided his eyes, but I could feel his stare like fire crawling across my skin. I want to vomit every time he enters the room. But I stay quiet. Because I’m supposed to. Because survival sometimes means silence.
But every second in this house is making me sick.
I don’t want to survive anymore. I want to live.
But what does that even look like?`

Not because I was angry.
Because I had no other space to put all this noise inside me. The baby was crying. The kids were fighting. The dishes were piling. I was still in yesterday’s clothes. No one helped. No one offered. And when I finally broke, I did it silently like always. I screamed until I couldn’t anymore. And then I wiped my face and made lunch.`

The kids were screaming, fighting, crying. My head felt like it was splitting open, but I held it all in. Cooked, cleaned, fetched, wiped, rocked, sang, served. I smiled at them while I crumbled on the inside. I am so fucking tired. My bones feel older than I am. Nobody sees the invisible load I carry. No one even says thank you. Just another day of being useful, not loved..`

Not tipsy. Not fun. Drunk. Gone. I wanted to walk up to a stranger and kiss them, just for one second of feeling like I’m not invisible. Like someone might want me and not just use me. I wanted lips that weren’t cruel, eyes that didn’t lie, arms that didn’t push. I wanted anything but this silence. I didn’t do it. But I thought about it all night. Still thinking about it now..`

He raped me again. Just now. I'm still sitting in the tub, steam rising like it might wash his filth off me, but it won’t. It never does. The kids were outside, laughing, playing. They had no idea what was happening in this bathroom. Does he love me? Is that his twisted way? Or am I just an easy target, like I’ve always been? First, my Cousin. Then Herman. Now him. How many more?
Why me?
What’s God waiting for?`

First night in like EVER that I went out without asking “permission” lol what am I, twelve?? Felt like ME again. Like the real me, not this house ghost.

Everyone walks right through me. I make food, I pick up clothes, I handle the kids, I smile when spoken to, but I’m not here. Not really. I’m floating. Drifting. Even she, my best friend, didn’t see me today. I sat across from her, hoping for anything, anything to make me feel real. I got a nod. That’s it. Sometimes I wonder if I died already and just haven’t realized it yet.`

I tried to ask if everything was okay, but she brushed me off. It’s the same friend who once held me while I cried over my past, the same one who laughed with me until 3AM about nonsense. And now... I don’t know what we are.
Is this how friendships die? Slowly, quietly, without warning?
It hurts more than it should. She was the first person in years who made me feel seen. If I lose her, I don’t know who I have left.`

She’s 13. My baby is not even 6. There’s no excuse. None. I lost it. I said things I shouldn’t have, but I meant every word. I will protect my kids even if it means losing friendships. Even if I have nothing left but them. We haven’t spoken in two weeks. Not a single word. I don’t think we’ll ever be the same. Maybe we were never really friends, maybe she was just a safe place that was never truly safe.`

The kind of numb that doesn't mean I feel nothing, just too much, all at once, until everything cancels itself out and I feel like glass. I'm walking through life with invisible cracks, and one wrong move could shatter me. I forgot what it feels like to laugh without guilt. To rest without anxiety. To be touched without fear. I wish I could disappear for a while. Not forever. Just long enough to find myself again.`

I should be excited.
But I’m not. Is it awful to say I wish they weren’t? I love them, just not here. Not in my space. They love control more than they love me. They will ask too many questions, criticize how I raise my kids, how I dress, how I breathe. I can already hear the passive-aggressive “advice.” I want a break, but not that kind. Sometimes family is just another kind of prison.`

She didn’t have to say it. It was in her tone, her eyes, the way she asked me, “Don’t you think it’s time you got your life together?”
As if I’m not already holding the pieces with bleeding hands.
As if waking up every day and facing this chaos isn’t enough.
I smiled politely and nodded. Then I went to the bathroom and stared at the mirror until I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. I don’t know what she wants from me. I gave everything I had. I have nothing left to give.`

In 19 days.
Nineteen. I counted. It’s the first countdown I’ve looked forward to in years. Our own place. No monster. No fake friendships. Just us. Me and the kids. A little nest I get to build with no eyes watching. No footsteps down the hall making me freeze in fear. or at least less footsteps though, I can sort of breathe soon. And maybe… maybe heal. I hope the silence there will feel like peace, not loneliness.`

Isn’t that strange? I wanted to leave this house for so long. I counted down every day. And now that it’s finally happening, there’s this deep ache in my chest like I’m about to jump off a cliff.
What if nothing changes?
What if the pain follows me there?
What if freedom isn't real, and I’m just moving my cage to a different room?
Still, I’m packing. Still, I’m hoping.
Please, God, just let this be the start of something new. Something quiet. Something safe.`

I laid in bed all night staring at the ceiling like it held the answers to questions I’m too afraid to ask out loud.
Questions like:
Is this it?
Is this all I’m meant to be, just a caretaker of broken things, while breaking quietly myself?
Everyone got up for work and I’m still here in my pajamas, holding a crying toddler on my hip, pretending I don’t want to run away. I made breakfast. Cleaned the kitchen. Changed diapers. But my soul feels untouched. Unnoticed. Like maybe I’m fading, little by little, and no one would know until I’m just... gone.`

COVID-19.
I don’t know what that means really, I mean, I do—but not in a way that makes sense in my life yet. They say lockdown is coming. 15 days left of “freedom,” whatever that even means when I’ve already felt imprisoned inside these walls for years.
But now... my husband can’t go to work.
We can’t pay rent.
We’re being kicked out.
And the only option is to move in with my sister, in law. God help me.
I hate that house. I hate her. Her daughters think they’re angels walking in stilettos but they’re little demons in disguise.
And her daughter’s fiancé?
He looks at me like I’m dessert he hasn’t tasted yet.
He whispers things when I walk by like it’s a game.
Like I haven’t already been violated enough in this fucking life.
I’m scared.
I feel like I’m falling into a black hole and everyone’s just cheering from the edge.`

It feels like the end of the world.
There’s this eerie silence outside, no cars, no music, no laughter. Just this ghostly stillness like Earth itself is holding its breath.
Inside, it’s a war zone.
Too many people in too little space.
I sleep on a couch now, if I even sleep at all. Every creak in the floorboards makes me flinch because he’s there. That man. The one who looks at me like I belong to him.
I don’t.
I never will.
But God, why does no one protect me? Why do I always have to fight alone?
Is this it?
Is COVID-19 the thing that wipes us out, or just the thing that finishes off what life already started breaking?`

The kids were screaming. My body felt like it was collapsing in on itself.
I tried to breathe.
I really did.
But the air felt like it belonged to someone else.
I’m so tired of being everyone’s everything.
The cook. The cleaner. The teacher. The babysitter. The babysitter’s babysitter.
All while feeling like a ghost in the background.
Not a mother.
Not a wife.
Not even a woman.
Just this... shell. This function.
I’m scared of dying from the virus.
But I think I’m even more scared of surviving like *this.*`

Not metaphorically, like literally grabbing my bag and disappearing.
The little one was screaming again. The house was thick with tension. He made a comment again, that man.
My husband said I was being dramatic.
Of course.
Because how dare I feel something in a world where my pain is inconvenient.
But where would I even go? I have no money. No car. No freedom.
So I did the next best thing.
I went for a walk in the backyard.
Ten minutes of sky and air and nothing.
Ten minutes of pretending I wasn’t me.
Then I walked back inside and put the kettle on.
Like always.`

I swore I wouldn’t.
I swore I didn’t need that anymore.
But something about the way my sister in law looked at me today, like I was a charity case with a leash, broke me.
She said I should “be grateful.”
Grateful.
For what?
That I’m trapped in a house where I’m watched, judged, sexualized, and ignored all at once?
Grateful that I’m surviving on scraps of dignity and dreams I can’t chase?
No.
Tonight I needed to feel something real.
The sting. The blood.
It reminded me I’m still here.
That I’m still mine.
Even if just for a few minutes.`

I lied.
I told him I wasn’t sad, just tired.
He hugged me.
I smiled.
And then I went into the bathroom and broke down because my child is learning to translate sadness into silence, just like me.
I don’t want that for him.
I don’t want him to grow up thinking love means surviving people who hurt you.
I have to do better.
I just don’t know how.`

I haven’t been touched with love in what feels like centuries.
I haven’t heard someone say “I see you” and mean it in longer than that.
My body is tired.
My heart is tired.
I want to scream.

He used to. Or maybe I only convinced myself he did.
Now, we barely speak unless it’s about food or kids or some broken thing that needs fixing.
And I keep thinking about what it would feel like to be kissed again, not out of duty, but out of longing.
To be touched like I mattered.
Sometimes I imagine a stranger in the night, someone who doesn’t know my story, just sees the ache in my eyes and chooses me anyway.
Is it wrong to crave love outside of the place I gave my vows to?
Or is it just what happens when love stops coming home?`

One bedroom.
A little balcony.

I imagined painting the walls soft blue. Hanging up fairy lights.

No yelling.
No footsteps behind me I don’t trust.

But I also feel… free.
I get to breathe a little.
Walk barefoot through the house without fear.
Dance with the kids in the lounge with music too loud.
Eat dinner on the floor.
Fall asleep on the couch if I want to.

When he’s gone, I feel like myself again.
Whoever that even is anymore.`

I met someone today.
On a random person in a live..

He sent me a message.
Not creepy.
Not flirty.
Just… kind.

We started talking.
About poems.
About life.
About the weather.

He writes.
He’s published books.
And when I told him about my writing,
he asked to read it.
I told him I’ll send him some of my poetry someday.
He didn’t judge.
He saw me.

He lives across the ocean.
9,000 miles away.
But in those few minutes,
I felt closer to him than I have to anyone in years.

Isn’t that wild?
How a stranger through a screen
can make you feel more alive
than the person lying in bed next to you for over a decade?`

I can't remember the last time he touched me with love.
The last time we kissed without resentment.
The last time he held me like he still wanted me.

I think it’s been over a year since we had sex.
And even before that,
it felt like obligation.
Like performance.
Like pretending.

Now we sleep back to back.
Cold.
Unreachable.
Strangers in the same bed.

And no one’s talking about it.
Not him.
Not me.
We're too busy ignoring the elephant bleeding in the middle of the room.`

It’s the absence of everything.

No accidental brushes.
No hands on my back.
Not even a sleepy arm thrown across me at 2AM.

It’s like I’m invisible.
Like I’m just the housekeeper.
The mother.
The burden.

But not a woman.
Not a wife.
Not someone he desires.

Not because I crave his affection,

without being used.`

He barely speaks to me anymore.
He walks past me like I’m furniture.

Parent in silence.
Exist in silence.

Now?
Just nothing.
And somehow, this hurts more.

Because at least anger meant I mattered enough to break.
Now it feels like I don’t even exist.

A shadow trailing behind him, unseen, unheard.

Sometimes I stand in the mirror and whisper,

Abandoned.

I can breathe.
I can smile at my phone when writing poetry

About him.

He was behind me,
arms around my waist,
forehead resting on the curve of my shoulder.

And I felt safe.
Not thrilled.
Not excited.
But calm.

Like I could finally exhale.

I woke up crying,

and make me laugh until I cried.

I imagined it was him.
The man from the messages.
The one who says my name like it matters.

It’s stupid, I know.
He lives on the other side of the world.
We’ve never even seen each other’s full face.

You live 9,000 miles away,
but I feel closer to you than I do to the man I share a bed with.

Isn’t that terrifying?
Isn’t that… beautiful, too?

You told me my words felt like home.

I ache to be touched in a way that says,

I crave a kind of love I’ve never really had

with a flower she picked from the neighbor’s weeds.

"For you, Mommy," she said.
Like it was a treasure.
Like I was worth giving it to.

And I broke.
Softly.

I cried into her tiny curls

He stayed.
Asked.
Listened.

He said something like, “You write your pain like it’s made of starlight.” or something.
I almost cried.

pain is something to hide.
It’s shame.

My son turning over with his soft snore.
