      “These are the pieces I never meant to share... but always needed to.<br><br>
      Welcome to the quietest corners of my heart.<br>
      This space holds pages from years of silent storms, secret screams, and raw truths I wrote when no one was watching.<br>
      They weren’t written for likes or applause... just survival.<br>
      Here, you’ll find diary entries, late night confessions, and fragments of the girl I was, the woman I’m becoming, and the ache that shaped me.<br>
      If you're reading this, maybe you’ve been there too. Maybe you're there now.<br>
      Either way, you’re not alone anymore.

        text: `It’s the middle of the night, and my mind feels like a storm that won’t let up. Everything inside me is screaming, screaming to be let out, but I can’t make a sound. Not out loud. Not in this house. So instead, I’m writing it here. My quiet scream.

A few months ago, something happened, something I never imagined would become part of my story. One of his closest friends, who had also become mine, someone I trusted, someone I laughed with, someone I considered family... he raped me. He assaulted me. And what tears me apart is how familiar the aftermath felt, how easily my body slid into numbness like it had done so many times before. I’m so used to being mistreated, so used to pain being folded into the background of my life, that I almost accepted it like muscle memory.

But please don’t think I didn’t fight. I fought with everything I had. But I guess I wasn’t strong enough, not physically. That part of me always feels too small, too powerless.

Emotionally though… I’ve become a master at survival. At burying the unspoken. At locking it away so deep that even I can pretend it never happened. I have to. Because telling the truth would mean losing one of the only people I have left.

His wife… she’s my best friend. My only friend. The first real connection I’ve had since Kayla died in 2015. After her, everything went silent. I stopped letting people in. I became too quiet, too shy, too emotional, or maybe just too… me. And yet, somehow, she saw past all that and chose me anyway. I can't risk losing her. I won’t.

But it’s hard. So fucking hard.

We all live under the same roof. Every day I see his face. Every day he walks around like nothing ever happened. He laughs. He jokes. He eats dinner at the same table. And I have to pretend, pretend I’m okay, pretend I’m not shaking inside, pretend that my skin doesn’t crawl every time he gets too close.

I don’t know how to act around him. Do I keep pretending, keep smiling like I don’t remember? Or do I shut him out, avoid him completely, and risk people asking questions? My husband would notice in a second. He knows the dynamics of this house, he knows how we all interact. If I change, he’ll see it. And then… I’ll have to tell him.

But what would I even say? "He raped me."

Will he believe me?

Doubt seeps in like poison because I have no proof. No bruises that still show. No photos. No witnesses. Just my word against his.

And hasn’t my word always fallen short?

That’s what eats at me most, not just what happened, but how alone I feel in holding it. I can’t write this on paper; he might find it. I can’t type it in my phone; my husband checks it sometimes. But here… here feels safe. This digital corner of the universe where no one knows my name, where I can scream without sound, cry without consequence.

Maybe one day, my future self will stumble across this entry and remember not the pain, but the power it took to live through it. To keep breathing. To carry this weight in silence, but still stand. Still fight. Still love.

I am struggling. God, I am struggling.

But I’m still here. I’m still surviving. And right now… that’s enough.

If by any chance someone out there reads this, and you're holding a secret that’s killing you from the inside out, know that I see you. I get it. If you need someone to listen without judgment, without a name, without fear… I’m here. Just a human heart on the other side of the screen. Open. Honest. And aching just like you.`

        text: `He hit me again.
No warning, no reason. Just a moment of silence between us and then his rage exploded into my skin. My cheek still stings. I pressed ice against it for a while, but what’s the point? It’s not the swelling that hurts the most, it’s the silence that follows. The way he turns his back like I deserved it. I sit here now in the dark, wondering when I stopped being human to him. I flinch when he breathes too loud. That’s not love. That’s fear in a wedding ring.`

Not to die.
Just to feel something that made sense. Something that bleeds, because my heart’s been bleeding in silence for so long that I needed to match it on the         outside. 
My wrist is a canvas of pain no one ever asks about. Each wound a sentence I never got to say out loud. I’ll cover them. I always do. But God, I wish someone would notice
