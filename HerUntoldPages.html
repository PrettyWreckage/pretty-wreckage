      <h2>The Garage</h2>
      <div class="story" id="story1">
It was a Saturday morning.

I was around eight years old. Still small, still soft, still someone who believed in family, in goodness, in being safe.

We were visiting my dad’s brother for the long weekend. I remember being excited to go somewhere new. I thought this was going to be a break — something fun.

The adults went out, left us kids behind. My cousin, the oldest, was in charge.

He was so sweet then. Before everything. Before the damage. Before the monster beneath the smile showed its face.

He made me feel like I belonged. While the others shoved me aside, he pulled me in. Made me feel wanted. Seen.

That day, the others were mean to me again. I don’t remember why. I just remember running inside and crying in a corner, quietly, like I always did.

He followed me.

Knelt next to me. Asked if I wanted to help him in the garage. Said it was important.

And just like that, my tears dried. That flicker of hope returned. Maybe this time I wouldn’t be pushed away.

I followed him.

We sat on the floor, building a wire car. He smiled. Spoke softly.

Then came the strange questions. “Can you keep a secret?”

I nodded. Of course I did. I wanted to belong. I wanted to be chosen.

He said I was becoming beautiful. I blushed. I smiled. I didn’t understand.

Then he asked me to prove it. Told me to lift my dress so he could see how I was changing.

My body went still.

He helped me up, whispering that it was okay, that it would feel good.

He lifted my dress.

I said, “I don’t like this.”

He said, “Trust me.”

Then he pulled down my underwear.

And touched me.

I froze. It didn’t feel good. It felt wrong. I tried to speak, but he gently placed his hand over my mouth.

Then the pain got worse.

He pushed me down.

Said I had to return the favor.

I didn’t understand.

He pulled down his pants. Told me to use my mouth.

I said no.

He wasn’t gentle anymore.

He shoved me so hard I couldn’t breathe. I remember gasping, like I was drowning.

Then came the worst pain of my life.

He forced himself inside me.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.

When he was done, he told me to clean myself. I walked to the bathroom like a ghost. Blood ran down my legs. Warm. Thick. Horrifying.

That was the first time.

Later that day, it happened again.

And again.

By the end of the weekend, it had happened more than five times.

I told someone. I told my dad.

He looked at me like I was the one who did something wrong. He shouted. Accused me of lying.

My mother looked at me like I’d shamed us all.

And my cousin? He smiled.

He kept being sweet to me.

Even after the rapes.

He would stroke my hair and call me special. Then take me again.

And somehow, I started believing maybe this was just what love looked like.

I stopped crying eventually. Not because it stopped hurting. It never stopped.

But because the tears did nothing.

I started cutting at ten.

Because I needed to feel something I chose. Something I could control.

I learned to hide everything. I smiled when I had to. Laughed when I was supposed to. Stayed dry-eyed. Stayed quiet.

But I was bleeding inside. Every single day.

The little girl I was died in that garage.

And no one noticed.

That’s where my life split in two, the before and the after.

And I don’t know if I’ll ever be whole again.
