      Welcome to <strong>Archive Poetry Pages</strong>, a quiet corner for my 2AM poetry, the ones I never finished.<br>
      Half-thoughts. Ghost lines. Lost rhymes. Maybe you'll help me finish them, maybe you'll just read and relate.<br><br>
      This is not a place for perfection. It's a place for honesty.<br>
      Scribble something down. Say what’s on your mind. All I ask is that you speak with kindness. 💬
