<body>
  <div class="poem-container">
I’m all kinds of shattered
a tangle of jagged edges and silent screams,
lost in the ruins of my restless mind,
chasing shadows that slip through my dreams.

I’m a storm no one dares to face,
a dark, pulling tide beneath calm seas,
a broken song on endless repeat,
haunted by the quiet of empty keys.

I walk through halls of memories,
where laughter echoes and love once lived,
now just whispers in the cold air,
ghosts of a past I can’t forgive.

Yet somewhere in this endless ache,
beneath the rubble and the pain,
I hold a flicker of fragile hope,
a light that calls me through the rain.

I’m still searching
for a soul just as lost as mine,
one who won’t run when darkness screams,
who sees the cracks and still lets light shine.

Someone who understands the silence,
who hears the screams beneath the calm,
who won’t demand I be fixed or whole,
but loves me perfectly broken and scarred.

Because maybe in this endless night,
two fractured hearts can find their spark
not to mend what’s torn apart,
but to hold the fractures close,
and find grace inside the scars.

I don’t know your name,
or if you even roam
but if you’re out there,
please don’t be afraid to come home.

Because I’m still here,
still broken, still aching
still searching, still hoping,
still waiting for you.
