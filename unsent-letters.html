    <h1>Unsent Letters</h1>
    <p><strong>These are the letters I never sent</strong>,the confessions, the closure, the honesty I only dared to whisper into paper.</p>
    <p>Each one holds a piece of my heart, folded between the lines. I wrote them for healing, remembering, and finally letting go.</p>
    <p>Some are for people I miss. Some are for those who never truly saw me. And some... are just for me.</p>
    <p>Read gently. These letters were never supposed to be found, but maybe, just maybe, they were meant for you after all.</p>
    <p>Xoxo❤️Me❤️oxoX

        <div class="flap-title">To the Monster Who Stole My Childhood</div>
      </div>
      <div class="letter-content">
        There are some wounds that never close.
They just learn to bleed quietly.

Today, I find myself writing to you, not because you deserve my words, but because the silence has grown too loud inside me. Maybe it’s time I bleed it out onto paper. Maybe it’s time I stop carrying the weight of your sins in my chest. You may never read this, you may never care, but I need to say it, for me.

I was eight.

Just eight.

A child with scraped knees and bedtime stories. A little girl who still believed that “family” meant safe arms and lullabies. You ruined that. You turned my world into something dark and twisted. You didn’t just take my innocence, you set fire to it and made me watch. You turned love into fear. You turned trust into a weapon. And you did it while wearing the face of someone I was told to love.

You didn’t just break me.
You unmade me.

Five years.
Five years of stolen nights and shattered boundaries. Of flinches I learned to hide, of screams I buried under my pillow. Five years of confusion, of shame that never belonged to me, of trying to survive a war no one else could see. You carved yourself into my childhood like a curse I couldn't lift.

To this day, I still feel your hands on my skin when no one is there. I still triple-check locks. I still sleep with a knife in the drawer. I still lose my breath when someone walks behind me. Your presence haunts the quiet moments, the ones that should’ve brought peace. You linger like smoke in a room I can’t air out.

What were you thinking?

Did you see how small I was?
Did you hear me begging with my eyes?
Was it power you wanted? Control? Or were you just that hollow?

I was quiet. I was soft. I didn’t know how to scream.
But silence was never a yes.
I never wanted you. I never asked for this.
I was a child, and you were a monster with a familiar name.

You wore the mask of safety, of family, of protector.
But underneath, you were rot.
You were the thing in the dark I was supposed to be safe *from.*

And now I carry what you left behind, the panic attacks. The guilt that doesn’t belong to me. The self-hate. The touch I flinch from, even when it's gentle. The trust I can’t give. The love I don’t think I deserve. You left me with pieces, and I’ve spent years trying to make something whole from them.

But let me be clear:

I will never forgive you.

Not out of vengeance.
Not out of spite.
But because some things are too cruel for forgiveness. Some wounds too deep to heal clean.
What you did doesn’t get to be erased. Not with time. Not with repentance. Not with tears you’ll never cry.

And God… I pray you never touch your daughter the way you touched me. I pray she never sees the monster behind your smile. I’ve stayed silent not to protect you — but to protect *her.* Because no child deserves to carry what I carried. I took that weight so she wouldn’t have to.

Maybe you pretend now, play the role of a man. But I know what you really are.
I know the rot beneath your skin.
And if there is justice, in this life or the next, may your soul rot for every breath you stole from me.

You left a grave in me.
But I climbed out.

I am still broken. Still healing. Still angry.
But I am here.

And you don’t get to take *that* from me.

So from the child you shattered, from the girl who cried herself to sleep for years:

I hate you.
I will never forgive you.
And I hope one day, you feel even a fraction of the hell you put me through.

Xoxo..... The girl you tried to destroy. But failed.

        <div class="flap-title">To the Kids Who Bullied Me</div>
      </div>
      <div class="letter-content">
I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve thought about writing this letter for years, to all of you, the ones who laughed, who whispered, who pointed, who turned my pain into your entertainment. Maybe you don’t remember me. Maybe I was just another face in the hallway to you, someone forgettable, someone you made fun of and moved on from.

But I remember you.

I remember everything.

I remember the first time I heard someone say, “Ew, what’s wrong with her skin?”
The way you looked at me like I was contagious. Like I was dirty. Diseased.
The way you stepped back, or whispered behind cupped hands, or stared with wide, disgusted eyes when my sleeves slipped up, or when I wore shorts on a hot day and you could see the raw, red, angry patches of my skin.

You didn’t know, or maybe you didn’t care, that what I had was 'psoriasis'.
An autoimmune disease. A chronic illness. Not something I could wash off, or hide, or control. My own body attacking itself. My own skin turning against me. It wasn’t just “a rash.” It wasn’t because I didn’t shower. It wasn’t gross. It wasn’t contagious. But none of you ever bothered to ask. You just judged. You mocked. You treated me like I didn’t belong.

And that hurt more than the disease ever did.

Do you know what it’s like to wake up every day and already feel ashamed of the body you’re living in? To have skin that cracks, bleeds, itches until you can't sleep? To dread the sunlight, gym class, pool parties, summer, even walking through the school corridors, because you know someone is going to say something? Laugh. Stare. Make you feel like a freak all over again?

You made it worse. So much worse.

You made me feel like I was a monster. Like something to be hidden. You made me afraid of being seen. You turned me into someone who kept her head down, who wore long sleeves in 35-degree heat, who sat in the back of the class hoping no one would notice her, who tried to make herself *smaller* so the jokes would stop.

I hated myself.

Because of you, I hated looking in mirrors. I hated my own skin. I hated showing up to school, knowing I’d have to endure another day of your cruelty. The nicknames. The whispers. The way some of you would call it disgusting to my face. The way others would smile at my pain like it was nothing. And the worst part — no one ever stood up for me. You all watched. Some joined in. Some laughed quietly, pretending it wasn’t a big deal.

But it *was* a big deal.

You made me feel less than human.
You made me feel like my illness defined me.
You made me feel like I would never be beautiful. Never be loved. Never be normal.

There were days I went home and cried until I couldn't breathe. Nights I scratched my skin raw just to feel something other than shame. Times I wondered why I had to be *me*. Why I had to have this skin. This body. Why I had to go through all of this, the disease, and the cruelty of kids who were supposed to be my classmates, maybe even my friends.

But I want you to know something:

I never chose this.

Psoriasis isn’t something I asked for. It’s not a punishment. It’s not a flaw. It’s a disease. One I’ve fought quietly, bravely, and constantly. I’ve taken medications that made me sick, tried creams that burned, cried in dermatologists’ offices when nothing worked. And still, I showed up. To school. To life. In spite of the pain. In spite of *you*.

I have survived things you will never understand, not just the illness, but the loneliness, the bullying, the deep, soul-crushing feeling of being unwanted, unloved, unseen. I have spent years trying to find my worth again. Trying to believe that I am more than my skin. That I am not what you said I was.

And I am not.

I am more.

More than your words.
More than your judgment.
More than your ignorance.

I don’t know if you’ve changed. I don’t know if you regret what you did. I don’t know if you even remember. But *I do*. I remember it all. And some nights, I still hear your laughter echoing in my head when I take off my clothes and see the marks on my skin. But now, I’m learning to see them differently. Not as shame. Not as something ugly. But as proof that I *survived*. That I am still here. That you didn’t break me completely, even though you tried.

I carry scars, both visible and invisible. And maybe I always will.
But I also carry strength.
And that’s something you will never be able to take from me.

I hope one day, if life ever hands you something hard, something you didn’t choose, you remember this. I hope you find more compassion than you gave. I hope you teach your children kindness instead of cruelty. I hope no one ever makes you feel the way you made me feel, like you weren’t enough, just because of something you couldn’t control.

To the kids who bullied me for something I didn’t choose:

You hurt me. You made me feel like I didn’t belong.
But I do.

I belong.
I am worthy.
I am still healing.
And I am still here.

Xoxo Me....
