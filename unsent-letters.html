    <h1>Unsent Letters</h1>
    <p><strong>These are the letters I never sent</strong>,the confessions, the closure, the honesty I only dared to whisper into paper.</p>
    <p>Each one holds a piece of my heart, folded between the lines. I wrote them for healing, remembering, and finally letting go.</p>
    <p>Some are for people I miss. Some are for those who never truly saw me. And some... are just for me.</p>
    <p>Read gently. These letters were never supposed to be found, but maybe, just maybe, they were meant for you after all.</p>
    <p>Xoxo❤️Me❤️oxoX

      </div>
      <div class="letter-content">
        There are some wounds that never close.
They just learn to bleed quietly.

Today, I find myself writing to you, not because you deserve my words, but because the silence has grown too loud inside me. Maybe it’s time I bleed it out onto paper. Maybe it’s time I stop carrying the weight of your sins in my chest. You may never read this, you may never care, but I need to say it, for me.

I was eight.

Just eight.

A child with scraped knees and bedtime stories. A little girl who still believed that “family” meant safe arms and lullabies. You ruined that. You turned my world into something dark and twisted. You didn’t just take my innocence, you set fire to it and made me watch. You turned love into fear. You turned trust into a weapon. And you did it while wearing the face of someone I was told to love.

You didn’t just break me.
You unmade me.

Five years.
Five years of stolen nights and shattered boundaries. Of flinches I learned to hide, of screams I buried under my pillow. Five years of confusion, of shame that never belonged to me, of trying to survive a war no one else could see. You carved yourself into my childhood like a curse I couldn't lift.

To this day, I still feel your hands on my skin when no one is there. I still triple-check locks. I still sleep with a knife in the drawer. I still lose my breath when someone walks behind me. Your presence haunts the quiet moments, the ones that should’ve brought peace. You linger like smoke in a room I can’t air out.

What were you thinking?

Did you see how small I was?
Did you hear me begging with my eyes?
Was it power you wanted? Control? Or were you just that hollow?

I was quiet. I was soft. I didn’t know how to scream.
But silence was never a yes.
I never wanted you. I never asked for this.
I was a child, and you were a monster with a familiar name.

You wore the mask of safety, of family, of protector.
But underneath, you were rot.
You were the thing in the dark I was supposed to be safe *from.*

And now I carry what you left behind, the panic attacks. The guilt that doesn’t belong to me. The self-hate. The touch I flinch from, even when it's gentle. The trust I can’t give. The love I don’t think I deserve. You left me with pieces, and I’ve spent years trying to make something whole from them.

But let me be clear:

I will never forgive you.

Not out of vengeance.
Not out of spite.
But because some things are too cruel for forgiveness. Some wounds too deep to heal clean.
What you did doesn’t get to be erased. Not with time. Not with repentance. Not with tears you’ll never cry.

And God… I pray you never touch your daughter the way you touched me. I pray she never sees the monster behind your smile. I’ve stayed silent not to protect you — but to protect *her.* Because no child deserves to carry what I carried. I took that weight so she wouldn’t have to.

Maybe you pretend now, play the role of a man. But I know what you really are.
I know the rot beneath your skin.
And if there is justice, in this life or the next, may your soul rot for every breath you stole from me.

You left a grave in me.
But I climbed out.

I am still broken. Still healing. Still angry.
But I am here.

And you don’t get to take *that* from me.

So from the child you shattered, from the girl who cried herself to sleep for years:

I hate you.
I will never forgive you.
And I hope one day, you feel even a fraction of the hell you put me through.

Xoxo..... The girl you tried to destroy. But failed.

        <div class="flap-title">To the Kids Who Bullied Me</div>
      </div>
      <div class="letter-content">
        I don’t know if you remember me. I don’t even know if I’d want you to. But I remember all of you, your faces, your laughter, your whispers behind my back, your words like knives. I remember them more vividly than I remember most of my childhood.

You made sure I could never forget.

I was just a kid, a kid who was already dealing with more than anyone my age should’ve had to carry. I had an autoimmune disease. A real illness. A body that attacked itself, a body that didn’t behave like it should have, a body that made every day feel like a battle just to show up, just to exist. And yet, you thought it was funny. You thought I was gross. Weird. Different. Less.

I didn’t choose this.

I didn’t ask for the illness, the medications, the side effects, the exhaustion, the hospital visits, the days I couldn’t get out of bed, the way my body looked or changed. It wasn’t something I could hide. And somehow, instead of showing kindness or curiosity or even just basic human decency, you treated me like I was something to laugh at. Something to reject. Something to destroy.

Do you have any idea what that does to a person?

I was already in pain. Already ashamed. Already feeling like my own body was betraying me — and then you added your cruelty to that. You mocked the way I walked. The way I couldn’t keep up. The way I missed school. The way I looked when the illness flared. The medication bloated my face, made me swell, made my skin break out, and you turned it into a game. You made me the punchline, and then acted like I was too sensitive when I cried.

You whispered when I entered the room.

You stared when I limped down the hallway.

You laughed when I sat alone, as if I wanted to be alone.

I wanted nothing more than to be normal. To blend in. To not be noticed. To have friends. To be seen for who I was on the inside, not for the things I couldn’t control. I wanted to be enough. But instead, every look you gave me reminded me that I wasn’t. You made me feel like I was broken in a way even love couldn’t reach.

I would go home and cry until I couldn’t breathe. I’d ask myself what I did wrong. Why me? Why did I have to be sick and be treated like trash for it? Why was it so hard for people to be kind?

Sometimes I didn’t want to go back to school at all. Sometimes I didn’t want to exist at all. That’s the weight your words and actions carried. You may have thought it was nothing. Just kids being kids. But I was bleeding inside, and you were the ones handing me the knives.

There were days I looked in the mirror and hated everything I saw, not because of my illness, but because you taught me to. You made me hate the body that was already struggling to survive. You made me feel like my illness was something shameful, something I deserved. And worst of all, you made me feel invisible and worthless.

But the truth is, I was always more than what you saw. More than your names, your giggles, your exclusion. I had a heart that wanted to love. A mind full of creativity. A soul that longed for connection. I was fighting a war inside my body, every single day, and still showing up. That should’ve made me strong, courageous, brave. But you made me feel small instead.

You didn’t see the strength it took for me just to come to school. The effort it took to smile when I was in pain. The loneliness I swallowed so I wouldn’t make others uncomfortable. You didn’t see the nights I cried into my pillow, asking God why I had to be me.

And still, I survived.

Despite you.
Despite your cruelty.
Despite the pain and shame you made worse.

I’m still here.

And I’m learning to love myself now — the same self you told me wasn’t lovable. I’m learning to see beauty in the body that didn’t give up. I’m learning to make peace with my scars, to speak out loud the truths you tried to silence. I’m learning that the things that made me different never made me less. In fact, they made me stronger than you’ll ever understand.

I don’t know if you’ve grown up. I don’t know if you even remember what you did. But I hope, somewhere deep down, a part of you realizes the damage words can do. I hope you teach your children better. I hope you never let another child feel what I felt, that they are unworthy because of a body that works differently.

I still carry the wounds. But I also carry the strength. The compassion. The empathy. The survival. And that makes me proud.

So here’s what I want to say now, with all the pain, honesty, and power in my heart:

You were cruel.
You broke something in me that I’ve had to spend years repairing.
But you did not destroy me.

I am still here.
And I am enough.
Even if you never saw it.

Xoxo...Me
