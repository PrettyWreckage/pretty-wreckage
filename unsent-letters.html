    <h1>Unsent Letters</h1>
    <p><strong>These are the letters I never sent</strong>—the confessions, the closure, the honesty I only dared to whisper into paper.</p>
    <p>Each one holds a piece of my heart, folded between the lines. I wrote them for healing, remembering, and finally letting go.</p>
    <p>Some are for people I miss. Some are for those who never truly saw me. And some... are just for me.</p>
    <p>Read gently. These letters were never supposed to be found—but maybe, just maybe, they were meant for you after all.</p>

        <div class="envelope-title">To the Monster Who Stole My Childhood</div>
        <p>
          Dear Monsters,<br><br>
          There are some wounds that never close.
They just learn to bleed quietly.

Today, I find myself writing to you — not because you deserve my words, but because the silence has grown too loud inside me. Maybe it’s time I bleed it out onto paper. Maybe it’s time I stop carrying the weight of your sins in my chest. You may never read this, you may never care — but I need to say it, for me.

I was eight.

Just eight.

A child with scraped knees and bedtime stories. A little girl who still believed that “family” meant safe arms and lullabies. You ruined that. You turned my world into something dark and twisted. You didn’t just take my innocence — you set fire to it and made me watch. You turned love into fear. You turned trust into a weapon. And you did it while wearing the face of someone I was told to love.

You didn’t just break me.
You *unmade* me.

Five years.
Five years of stolen nights and shattered boundaries. Of flinches I learned to hide, of screams I buried under my pillow. Five years of confusion, of shame that never belonged to me, of trying to survive a war no one else could see. You carved yourself into my childhood like a curse I couldn't lift.

To this day, I still feel your hands on my skin when no one is there. I still triple-check locks. I still sleep with a knife in the drawer. I still lose my breath when someone walks behind me. Your presence haunts the quiet moments — the ones that should’ve brought peace. You linger like smoke in a room I can’t air out.

What were you thinking?

Did you see how small I was?
Did you hear me begging with my eyes?
Was it power you wanted? Control? Or were you just that hollow?

I was quiet. I was soft. I didn’t know how to scream.
But silence was never a yes.
I never wanted you. I never asked for this.
I was a child — and you were a monster with a familiar name.

You wore the mask of safety, of family, of protector.
But underneath, you were rot.
You were the thing in the dark I was supposed to be safe *from.*

And now I carry what you left behind — the panic attacks. The guilt that doesn’t belong to me. The self-hate. The touch I flinch from, even when it's gentle. The trust I can’t give. The love I don’t think I deserve. You left me with pieces, and I’ve spent years trying to make something whole from them.

But let me be clear:

I will never forgive you.

Not out of vengeance.
Not out of spite.
But because some things are too cruel for forgiveness. Some wounds too deep to heal clean.
What you did doesn’t get to be erased. Not with time. Not with repentance. Not with tears you’ll never cry.

And God… I pray you never touch your daughter the way you touched me. I pray she never sees the monster behind your smile. I’ve stayed silent not to protect you — but to protect *her.* Because no child deserves to carry what I carried. I took that weight so she wouldn’t have to.

Maybe you pretend now — play the role of a man. But I know what you really are.
I know the rot beneath your skin.
And if there is justice — in this life or the next — may your soul rot for every breath you stole from me.

You left a grave in me.
But I climbed out.

I am still broken. Still healing. Still angry.
But I am here.

And you don’t get to take *that* from me.

So from the child you shattered, from the girl who cried herself to sleep for years:

I hate you.
I will never forgive you.
And I hope one day, you feel even a fraction of the hell you put me through.

— The girl you tried to destroy. But failed.
